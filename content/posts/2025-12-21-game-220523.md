Snapbreak Games has officially announced the release date for the mobile version of their atmospheric puzzle game, Silt, set to launch on iOS and Android on January 20, 2026. This underwater adventure blends horror and puzzle elements, immersing players in a dark, flooded world filled with hostile creatures and eerie visuals that evoke a sense of dread and curiosity.

In Silt, players take on the role of a diver who can temporarily inhabit marine life, using their unique abilities to solve intricate puzzles and navigate through the depths of the ocean. The games hand-drawn monochrome art style adds to its unsettling atmosphere, drawing comparisons to indie classics like Limbo and Inside. With a demo version available at launch, players can experience the haunting world of Silt before making a one-time purchase to unlock the full game.

Originally released on PC and consoles in the summer of 2022, Silt has garnered positive reviews, boasting a 77% approval rating on Steam. As we approach the mobile release, it will be exciting to see how the game translates to touch controls and whether it can capture the same atmospheric tension that made the original a hit. Are you ready to dive into the depths of horror with Silt?
