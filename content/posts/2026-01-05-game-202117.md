2025 marked a significant downturn for Xbox consoles in the UK, with sales plummeting nearly 40% compared to the previous year. This decline positions 2025 as the worst year on record for Xbox hardware, highlighting a troubling trend for Microsofts gaming division.

While the entire console market faced challenges, with PlayStation 5 sales also declining by 19%, the sharper drop in Xbox sales raises questions about Microsofts strategic shift. The company has increasingly moved away from traditional console exclusives, opting instead for multiformat releases that have seen titles like Gears of War and Forza Horizon make their way to PlayStation.

As the gaming landscape evolves, it will be interesting to see how Microsoft adapts its strategy moving forward. Will they refocus on hardware, or continue to embrace a more inclusive gaming ecosystem?
