Square Enix's recent comparison video showcases the capabilities of the Switch 2 by putting it side by side with the PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC versions of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade. What stands out is how the Switch 2, despite being less powerful, manages to maintain impressive visual quality, particularly in lighting, which the game's director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized as crucial for graphical fidelity.

The video, while running at 30 frames per second, highlights subtle differences in texture quality, but overall, the Switch 2 version holds its ground. This is a significant achievement considering the technical limitations of a handheld device. The developers focused on optimizing other graphical elements, ensuring that the core experience remains visually appealing without compromising on essential aspects like lighting.

As we look forward to the game's release on January 22, the question remains: will the Switch 2's performance be enough to satisfy the expectations of dedicated gamers?
