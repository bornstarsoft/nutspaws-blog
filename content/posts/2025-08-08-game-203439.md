Konami has officially announced the release window for Fox Hunt, an innovative multiplayer mode set to launch in Fall 2025 for the highly anticipated remake, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This mode promises to deliver a fresh online experience, distinct from the legacy of Metal Gear Online, and is being crafted by veteran designer Yu Sahara, known for his work on several titles in the series.

Fox Hunt is described as a "completely original" mode that leverages the iconic stealth gameplay of the Metal Gear franchise while incorporating modern multiplayer dynamics. Sahara emphasizes the evolution of multiplayer gaming since the original Metal Gear Online, aiming to create a thrilling hide-and-seek experience enhanced by cutting-edge graphics and gameplay mechanics.

As we eagerly await the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater on August 28, 2025, fans are left wondering how Fox Hunt will redefine multiplayer interactions in the series. Will it capture the essence of what made Metal Gear Online beloved while adapting to the current gaming landscape? Only time will tell.
