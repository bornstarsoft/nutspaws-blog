In a surprising turn of events, Sega has inadvertently disclosed the sales figures for some of its most popular franchises, including Sonic, Persona, and Like A Dragon. This information was tucked away in a presentation document intended for investors, which has since been removed but not before being archived by the gaming community. The figures reveal significant milestones for these titles, with Persona 5 Royale leading the pack at over 7 million units sold.

Sonic Frontiers has also made a notable impact, with sales reaching approximately 4.5 million copies. Meanwhile, the Like A Dragon series continues to build its legacy, with recent entries Infinite Wealth and Like A Dragon selling 1.66 million and 2.86 million units, respectively. These numbers not only highlight the commercial success of Sega's franchises but also provide insight into the gaming market's current trends and consumer preferences.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how Sega leverages this data to inform future releases and marketing strategies. Will these figures influence their game development direction, or will they continue to innovate in the ever-evolving gaming landscape?
