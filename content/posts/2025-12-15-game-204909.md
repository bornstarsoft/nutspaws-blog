Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, initially developed in 1991 by Chris Oberth, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also supports archival efforts aimed at preserving the legacy of 8-bit gaming.

The release includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that dives into the game's troubled past, Oberth's career, and the broader challenges of preserving video game history. This initiative highlights the importance of safeguarding our digital heritage and the stories behind the games that shaped our childhoods.

As we look forward to the 2025 release, it raises an intriguing question: how many more hidden gems from the past are waiting to be discovered and shared with a new generation of gamers?
