In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, is set to close its doors after failing to secure a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. This announcement serves as a stark reminder of the challenges faced by game developers in an ever-evolving industry where partnerships and funding are crucial for survival.

Founded in 2023 by former Ubisoft Toronto staff, Bad Brain Game Studios was part of NetEase's expansion into the Canadian gaming market. However, with the impending shutdown on November 17th, 2025, the company is now open to discussions regarding the acquisition of its intellectual property and ongoing projects. This situation reflects a broader trend within NetEase, which has been scaling back its overseas operations, raising questions about the future of its remaining studios.

As we witness the closure of yet another gaming studio, it prompts us to consider the sustainability of game development in today's market. Will we see a shift towards more stable partnerships, or will the industry continue to face turbulence? The fate of Midnight Riders may just be the tip of the iceberg in a rapidly changing landscape.
