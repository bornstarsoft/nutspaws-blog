Elden Ring's upcoming release on the Nintendo Switch 2 has raised eyebrows, particularly due to reported performance issues that could hinder the gaming experience. At Gamescom, journalists noted that the game struggles to maintain its maximum framerate of 30fps in handheld mode, with some claiming it drops as low as 15fps. This significant dip in performance has led to concerns about the overall playability of what is otherwise a visually impressive title.

Felix Sanchez from Nintendo Life described the experience as reminiscent of playing older games with severe framerate issues, stating, "It was like playing Ocarina of Time. 20 frames-per-second, sometimes it was like 15 frames-per-second." Such feedback raises questions about the optimization of the game for the Switch 2, especially considering its popularity and the high expectations from fans.

As we await the official release of Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition later this year, it remains to be seen whether Bandai Namco will address these performance concerns. Will the final product live up to the standards set by its predecessors, or will it fall short in delivering a smooth gameplay experience?
