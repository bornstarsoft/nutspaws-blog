In a surprising turn of events, Rich Vogel, a veteran in the MMO gaming industry, has confirmed the closure of his studio T-Minus Zero Entertainment, which was recently established under the umbrella of NetEase Games. This closure highlights the challenging market conditions that many gaming studios face today, particularly when it comes to securing necessary funding for new projects.

Founded just a year ago, T-Minus Zero was poised to make an impact in the gaming world, with Vogel at the helm, known for his work on iconic titles like Ultima Online and Star Wars: Galaxies. Despite the promising start, the studio's inability to navigate the current economic landscape ultimately led to its downfall. Vogel expressed gratitude for the support from NetEase, indicating that the team will continue to seek new opportunities in the gaming sector.

This closure raises questions about the sustainability of new gaming studios in an increasingly competitive market. As we look ahead, will we see a shift in how studios approach funding and development?
