Nintendo has officially announced that Drag x Drive will be launching exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14, 2025, priced at $30 AUD. This innovative game allows players to use the Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode, creating a unique experience where you mimic arm movements to steer and drive a wheelchair in an engaging 3-on-3 basketball game.

Having had the chance to play Drag x Drive for about thirty minutes at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the mouse controls functioned. The gameplay was far more exhilarating than I had anticipated from the initial reveal video, showcasing the potential for immersive and interactive gaming on the new console.

As we approach the release date, excitement is building around how Drag x Drive will redefine sports gaming on the Nintendo Switch 2. Will you be picking up this title when it launches? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below!
