October is shaping up to be an exhilarating month for Xbox Game Pass subscribers, with the highly anticipated Ninja Gaiden 4 leading the charge. Alongside this, players can also look forward to the remastered Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and DoubleFines new title, Keeper. These additions not only highlight the platform's commitment to delivering fresh content but also cater to a diverse range of gaming preferences.

However, its essential to note that some titles will be leaving the service soon, including Cocoon, Core Keeper, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed. This shift comes on the heels of Microsofts recent updates to Game Pass offerings and pricing, making it a pivotal moment for the subscription service. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, how will these changes impact your gaming experience this month?
