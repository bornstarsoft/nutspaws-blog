In an impressive display of popularity, the Octopath Traveler series has now surpassed 6 million units sold worldwide. This milestone, announced by Square Enix, encompasses both physical shipments and digital downloads of the original Octopath Traveler, its sequel, and the latest entry, Octopath Traveler 0. This achievement marks a significant increase from the 5 million units reported just a year ago, highlighting the series' growing fanbase and enduring appeal.

The first Octopath Traveler game alone has sold over 3 million copies, while its sequel reached the 1 million mark shortly after its release in June 2023. To celebrate this achievement, Square Enix is offering a 60% discount on the first two games during the holiday season, making it a perfect time for new players to dive into this captivating RPG universe. With the Steam Winter Sale running until January 5, 2026, the series is more accessible than ever.

As the Octopath Traveler series continues to thrive, one can't help but wonder what the future holds for this beloved franchise. Will we see more innovative gameplay mechanics or perhaps a new installment that expands the universe even further? Only time will tell.
