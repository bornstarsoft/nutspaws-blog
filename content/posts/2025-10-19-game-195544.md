After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is finally set to release in Q4 of 2025, marking a significant moment in retro gaming history. Originally developed by Affinix Software from 1999 to 2001, this tactical RPG faced cancellation in 2002, but thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign by Incube8 Games, it has been revived and is ready to captivate a new generation of gamers.

Infinity promises to deliver a rich narrative, featuring a disgraced knight who must navigate a world torn by conflict and ancient evil. With its unique tactical battle system, over 30 explorable areas, and stunning 8-bit graphics, this game is not just a nostalgic trip down memory lane but a fully realized RPG experience. Pre-orders are now available, offering various editions and collectible items that will surely excite fans and collectors alike.

As we look forward to the release, one can't help but wonder: will Infinity set a new standard for retro game revivals and inspire more classic titles to return to the gaming scene? Let's keep our fingers crossed for this remarkable comeback!
