The recent release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has sparked a heated debate among gamers regarding the use of generative AI in its artwork, particularly for in-game calling cards. Activision has confirmed that AI tools were utilized in the development of some assets, but the specifics remain vague, leaving players to speculate about the extent of AI's involvement.

While some fans embrace the integration of AI as a natural evolution in gaming, others express disappointment, arguing that a major title like Black Ops 7 should prioritize human artistry over automated processes. This sentiment is echoed on platforms like Reddit, where players lament the potential loss of jobs for talented artists in the industry.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve with technology, the question remains: will the use of AI in creative processes redefine the industry for better or worse? Only time will tell how this trend will impact the future of game design and artistry.
