Peter Molyneux, the legendary creator of the Fable series, recently expressed his emotional reaction to the gameplay reveal of the new Fable reboot by Playground Games. In an interview with IGN, Molyneux admitted that he teared up while watching the trailer, feeling a profound sense of nostalgia and pride for the world he helped create. His heartfelt response underscores the lasting impact that Fable has had on both gamers and developers alike.

Molyneux praised Playground's decision to retell the Fable story rather than continue from where the original games left off, believing that this approach allows for a fresh perspective while honoring the beloved franchise. He noted clever references in the trailer, such as a family turning to stone, which evoke the whimsical yet dark charm that Fable is known for. Despite some minor critiques about the aesthetic feel of the game, Molyneux remains excited to dive into this new chapter of the Fable universe.

As we await the release of the new Fable, Molyneux's emotional connection to the franchise serves as a reminder of the power of storytelling in gaming. Will this reboot capture the essence of what made the original Fable so special, or will it forge a new path entirely? Only time will tell.
