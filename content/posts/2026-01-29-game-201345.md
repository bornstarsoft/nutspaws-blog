Indie game enthusiasts and retro lovers alike will want to mark February 6, 2026, on their calendars, as Team Afternoon is set to release their innovative game, "Don't You Trust Me?" for free on Steam. This unique title takes players on a nostalgic journey back to the Windows 98 era, blending strategy, puzzle-solving, and simulation into a captivating experience that challenges conventional gaming narratives.

At the heart of the game lies the intriguing task of crafting a "fake clear video" for a failed dungeon raid. Players step into the shoes of a video editor, meticulously arranging clips of chaotic battles into a seamless narrative of victory. The precision required to create a perfect action sequence on an 8-tick timeline is a fresh take on gameplay, emphasizing creativity and strategy over traditional combat mechanics. With post-processing features that enhance the storytelling, players can transform mundane moments into epic highlights.

"Don't You Trust Me?" not only offers engaging gameplay but also presents a satirical narrative that contrasts the heroic facade with the chaotic reality behind the scenes. As players navigate this ironic world, they will find themselves questioning the nature of heroism and the stories we tell. Will you be ready to create your own miracles on February 6?
