Exciting news for gamers! The beloved Far Cry 3 Classic Edition is set to receive a significant update that will enhance gameplay on the PS5 and PS5 Pro, bringing the frame rate up to a smooth 60 FPS. This update, announced by Ubisoft, is a welcome addition for fans of the iconic 2012 title, ensuring a more fluid gaming experience for those playing on current-generation consoles.

Originally released in November 2012, Far Cry 3 has sold over 10 million copies, a testament to its enduring popularity. While Xbox Series S and X players have enjoyed 60 FPS gameplay for some time, PS4 owners have expressed disappointment over the lack of similar updates. The update is scheduled for release on January 21, and it will be available as part of the Far Cry Anthology Bundle, currently offered at a discounted price.

As we look forward to this update, one has to wonder: will this revival of a classic title reignite interest in the Far Cry series, or will it simply serve as a nostalgic trip down memory lane?
