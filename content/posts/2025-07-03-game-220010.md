In a surprising turn of events, Techland, the Polish developer behind the popular Dying Light franchise, has reportedly cancelled two of its upcoming game projects. This decision comes on the heels of significant financial losses amounting to approximately 37.3 million USD, as reported by Puls Biznesu. The cancellation raises questions about the future of Techland's ambitious plans, particularly a new open-world fantasy action RPG that had been in development since 2022.

The RPG was set to be helmed by a team of industry veterans, including former CD Projekt Red staff who contributed to critically acclaimed titles like The Witcher series and Cyberpunk 2077. Techland's CEO had previously expressed optimism about this new IP, emphasizing the goal to meet high expectations after nearly a decade without a new franchise. However, with the recent cancellations, fans and industry observers are left wondering which projects will continue and what this means for the future of the Dying Light series.

As Techland gears up for the release of Dying Light: The Beast, a standalone experience that evolved from a planned DLC, the gaming community is eager to see how these changes will impact the beloved franchise. Will Techland bounce back from this setback, or will the cancellations hinder their creative momentum? Only time will tell.
