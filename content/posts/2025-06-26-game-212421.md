Launched by The New York Times after the success of Wordle, this game invites players to sort 16 random words into four categories based on shared themes. The thrill lies not just in solving the puzzle but in the clever connections that can stump even the most seasoned wordsmiths.

To enhance your gameplay, remember that simplicity is key. Often, the most straightforward connections yield the best results. And with only four guesses allowed in 24 hours, it's wise to think carefully before making your selections. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned player, these insights can elevate your experience and make each game more enjoyable.
