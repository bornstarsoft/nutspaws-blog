Sovietborgs is making waves in the gaming community as a unique top-down runn gun shooter that transports players to an alternate timeline dominated by the Soviet Empire. Developed by @RetroSumus, known for their work on Xenocider for the Dreamcast, this game promises to blend nostalgia with innovative gameplay. Players will command a squad of three Sovietborgs, navigating a post-apocalyptic world teeming with monsters and rebel factions, all while drawing inspiration from classic titles like The Chaos Engine and Gauntlet.

What sets Sovietborgs apart is its commitment to classic gaming platforms, including Sega Genesis, Neo Geo, and Dreamcast, alongside modern crowdfunding via Indiegogo. The games pre-rendered graphics echo the beloved styles of Donkey Kong Country and Vectorman, while its soundtrack channels the iconic themes of Red Alert and the Strike series. This fusion of retro aesthetics and modern gameplay mechanics is sure to resonate with both nostalgic gamers and new players alike.

As the crowdfunding campaign unfolds, the gaming community eagerly anticipates the potential completion of this project. Will Sovietborgs redefine the runn gun genre and capture the hearts of gamers worldwide? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: the spirit of retro gaming is alive and well.
