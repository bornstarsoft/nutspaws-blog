The 'We Were Here' series, developed by Total Mayhem Games, has captivated players with its unique blend of co-op puzzle-solving and immersive storytelling. This first-person puzzle game, reminiscent of escape room experiences, has garnered a loyal fanbase since its debut. With the current 60% discount on the entire series bundle on Steam, now is the perfect time for both newcomers and seasoned players to dive into this engaging world of mystery and teamwork.

Starting with the original game, players are thrust into the eerie Castle Rock, where communication and collaboration are key to solving intricate puzzles. Each subsequent title has built upon its predecessor, introducing new mechanics and challenges that keep the gameplay fresh. While the latest installment, 'We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip,' offers a standalone experience aboard a ship, it still retains the essence of what made the series popular: clever puzzles and the need for teamwork.

As the series continues to evolve, it raises questions about the future of cooperative gaming. Will we see more innovative mechanics that challenge our problem-solving skills? Or will the narrative take center stage once again? One thing is for sure: the 'We Were Here' series has set a high bar for co-op puzzle games, and we can't wait to see what Total Mayhem Games has in store next.
