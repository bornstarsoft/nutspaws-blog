In a surprising turn of events, a pre-release build of the much-anticipated but ultimately canceled PS5 game, Concord, has surfaced online. This development build, dubbed FWChaos, is reportedly dated November 14, 2023, just nine months ahead of its intended launch in August 2024. The leak has sparked intrigue among gaming enthusiasts, especially given the authenticity confirmed by VGC, a reputable source in the gaming industry.

Upon loading the game, players are greeted with a login screen that cannot be bypassed, but an included .ini file allows access to a developer menu. This menu leads to a Select Freegunner screen, although it appears to be incomplete, as no Freegunners are available for selection. Despite this limitation, the game does offer glimpses into its structure, featuring a partially developed Galactic Guide and a Crew section detailing 16 playable characters, along with their variant outfits.

The leak raises questions about the game's potential and what might have been had it not been axed. As we delve deeper into the world of game development and the impact of leaks, one can't help but wonder: what does this mean for future projects from Sony Interactive Studios and Firewalk Studios? Will we see more transparency, or will the shadow of Concord linger as a cautionary tale in the gaming community?
