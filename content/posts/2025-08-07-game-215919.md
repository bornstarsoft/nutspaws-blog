MiHoYo has announced that support for the PS4 version of Genshin Impact will officially end in April 2026, a clear indication that the limitations of last-gen hardware can no longer keep up with the game's evolving demands. The discontinuation process will unfold in three phases, starting with the game's removal from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025, followed by the delisting of in-game purchases on February 25, 2026, and culminating in the cessation of all updates on April 8, 2026.

This decision highlights the ongoing transition in the gaming industry as developers increasingly prioritize newer hardware capabilities to deliver richer gaming experiences. Players who have enjoyed Genshin Impact on PS4 will need to transition to PS5 or other supported platforms to continue their adventures without interruption. MiHoYo assures that progress will remain intact across platforms, allowing players to pick up right where they left off.

As we move closer to the end of PS4 support, it raises questions about the future of gaming on older consoles. Will more developers follow suit, or will there be ways to optimize experiences for last-gen systems? Only time will tell.
