The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as Christopher Judge, the voice of Kratos in the acclaimed God of War series, hinted at a significant announcement coming this summer. During a recent conversation at Fan Expo in Vancouver, Judge revealed that fans will soon hear about what Santa Monica Studio is working on, igniting speculation about the next installment in the beloved franchise.

While Judge confirmed he won't be part of the upcoming God of War Trilogy Remake, which will feature the original Kratos actor TC Carson, he did tease that the remake will introduce a new fighting system. This revelation adds to the anticipation surrounding the future of the series, especially after the success of 2022's God of War Ragnarok. With creative director Cory Barlog reportedly working on an unannounced project, fans are eager to see what innovative direction the studio will take next.
