In a surprising turn of events, the PlayStation 5 has outsold the Nintendo Switch 2 during the holiday sales season, achieving remarkable sales figures that have caught the attention of gamers and industry analysts alike. With 8.1 million units sold in the last quarter of 2025, the PS5 is now at a staggering total of 92.2 million consoles sold, nearly matching the sales trajectory of its predecessor, the PS4, despite a higher price point of $550 compared to the PS4's sub-$300 price during a similar timeframe.

Nintendo's latest financial report revealed that the Switch 2 managed to sell around 7.01 million units, which, while impressive, still falls short of the PS5's performance. This outcome is particularly noteworthy given the initial stock shortages that plagued the PS5's launch due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems that Sony's strategic pricing and promotional efforts, especially during Black Friday, have paid off significantly.

As we look ahead, the competition between these two gaming giants remains fierce. Will the PS5 continue to maintain its momentum, or will the Nintendo Switch 2 find a way to reclaim its market position? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the gaming landscape is more exciting than ever.
