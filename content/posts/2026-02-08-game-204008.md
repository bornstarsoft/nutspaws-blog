If you enjoy puzzle games but prefer a more relaxed experience, then Botany Manor is the perfect fit for you. Currently available for free on the Epic Games Store, this cozy first-person puzzle game invites players to step into the shoes of botanist Arabella Greene. Set in a beautifully rendered Victorian manor, the game offers a delightful blend of exploration and botanical research without the overwhelming difficulty often found in similar titles.

Botany Manor strikes a balance between challenge and accessibility, making it ideal for casual gamers. Lead developer Laure De May emphasized that the game is designed to be peaceful and engaging, with puzzles that require thought but dont leave players feeling frustrated. This makes it a refreshing alternative to more intense puzzle games like The Witness or Blue Prince, which can be daunting for many.

With its unique charm and inviting gameplay, Botany Manor is not just another puzzle game; it's an opportunity to unwind and enjoy a rich narrative while solving puzzles at your own pace. Why not take advantage of this limited-time offer and dive into the world of Botany Manor? What other cozy games do you think deserve the spotlight?
