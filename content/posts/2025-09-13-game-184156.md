The recent registration of domain names related to the next Super Mario Bros movie has sparked renewed interest in a title leak that surfaced two months ago. An image of limited edition Old Spice deodorant cans featuring Luigi and Yoshi, branded with the title "The Super Mario Galaxy Movie," has resurfaced, and with it, speculation about the film's direction and themes. This development could indicate that the sequel will delve into new adventures, including Luigi's journey through a desert and Yoshi's escapades in New York.

While some initially dismissed the deodorant cans as a marketing gimmick, the recent domain registrations by NBCUniversal lend credibility to the idea that the title may indeed be legitimate. The registrations of names like "supermariogalaxy.movie" suggest that Universal is preparing for a significant release, possibly confirming the title and hinting at the storyline.

As we await further announcements from Nintendo, particularly during the upcoming Nintendo Direct, fans are left to ponder: what other surprises might be in store for the beloved franchise? Will this sequel live up to the expectations set by its predecessor?
