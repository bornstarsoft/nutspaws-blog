The highly anticipated mobile puzzle game, **Classroom of the Elite ~Merge Puzzle Special Exam~**, is set to make its debut in the Crunchyroll Game Vault, with pre-registration now open on both the App Store and Google Play. Originally released in Japan in February 2024, this game promises to deliver an engaging experience for fans of the series, featuring missions, character levels, and unlockable "school miniscapes" that enhance the gameplay through scenario progression.

One of the standout features of this game is its commitment to providing a rich narrative experience, complete with full voice-acting and new story content. Notably, the developers have pledged to eliminate microtransactions, which is a refreshing approach in today's gaming landscape. Players will have the opportunity to build—or break—relationships within the game, adding a layer of strategy and emotional engagement that could resonate well with fans of the franchise.

As we look forward to the release of the fourth season of the Classroom of the Elite anime, which is yet to receive a premiere date, this game could serve as a perfect companion for fans eager to dive deeper into the story. With the light novel series also progressing into its third year, there's never been a better time to explore the world of Classroom of the Elite through this innovative puzzle game. Are you ready to take on the challenge?
