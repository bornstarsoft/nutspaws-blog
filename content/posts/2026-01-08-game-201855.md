The newly launched puzzle game AiliA offers a unique twist on traditional gameplay by incorporating mirror mechanics that are not just visual but fully interactive. Developed by IceToad Studio LLC and published by Gamirror Games, AiliA invites players to step into the shoes of Aria, a young girl navigating a world where reality and reflection intertwine. With over 100 puzzles spread across seven distinct themed areas, players will find themselves challenged in ways that require both creativity and strategic thinking.

What sets AiliA apart is its innovative use of mirrors, allowing players to manipulate their environment by adjusting angles and positions to reveal hidden paths and solutions. This gameplay mechanic is further enhanced by the inclusion of water reflections and recursive mirror structures, making each puzzle a captivating experience. Additionally, the game features boss encounters that cleverly incorporate these mirror mechanics, ensuring that players remain engaged and challenged throughout their journey.

For those eager to dive into this reflective adventure, a free demo is available on Steam, and a special collaboration bundle with Moncage offers an additional discount for puzzle enthusiasts. As you explore the intertwining stories of Aria and her sister Lia, you might find yourself pondering: how do our reflections shape our reality?
