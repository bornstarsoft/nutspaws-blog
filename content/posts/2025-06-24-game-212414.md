In a troubling turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated mass layoff proceedings that could affect over 100 employees. This comes on the heels of a rocky launch for MindsEye, which has been plagued by technical issues and bugs, leading to a wave of refunds from PlayStationâ€”a scenario reminiscent of the infamous Cyberpunk 2077 launch.

The Edinburgh-based developer has begun a 45-day consultation process with its staff, a requirement under UK law when planning to lay off 100 or more employees. With an estimated 300 UK-based staff and an additional 200 overseas, the implications of these layoffs are significant for both the company and the gaming community. The studio expressed its heartbreak over the situation, emphasizing its commitment to delivering a great player experience.

As the gaming industry continues to grapple with the challenges of development and player expectations, the fate of Build a Rocket Boy serves as a stark reminder of the pressures faced by studios today. Will they be able to recover from this setback and regain the trust of their players? Only time will tell.
